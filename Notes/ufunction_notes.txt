UFUNCTION

Marks a C++ function visible to Unreal's reflection system.
Enables it to be called by Blueprints, replication, delegates, or other engine systems.
Allows metadata specifiers like BlueprintCallable, Server, Client, etc.


Most common specifiers and uses:


BlueprintCallable	
Function can be called from a Blueprint graph.

BlueprintPure	
Function is read-only, does not modify state; can be used as a “getter” in Blueprints.

BlueprintImplementableEvent	
Function declared in C++, implemented in Blueprint only.

BlueprintNativeEvent	
Function declared in C++, optionally overridable in Blueprint.

Server	
Marks function to run on server in networked multiplayer. Requires WithValidation in UE4.

Client	
Marks function to run on the owning client.

NetMulticast	
Function runs on all clients and the server.

Reliable / Unreliable	
Controls network replication guarantee for Server/Client/Multicast functions.

Exec	
Function can be called from in-game console.

Category="..."	
Organizes function in Blueprint editor menus.

WithValidation	
In networked functions, adds a bool Validate() function for security.
