# UE5 GAS: Aura Master of the Elements

⚠️This is still a Work-In-Progress. Very early in development! About 10% done. ⚠️

---
This is a Top-Down Online Multiplayer RPG. 

I am currently making this by following a udemy course about Unreal Engine 5's Gameplay Ability System (GAS).

There is no gameplay yet, just a scene with some random stuff, I'm still mainly setting up the code to build on it later. 

Currently implemented features:
- Character movement
- Ability system components
- Attribute sets replicated for online play
- Basic Health and Mana UI
- Some basic Gameplay effects
